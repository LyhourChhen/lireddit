# lireddit

This repo is a clone of [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad)'s [lireddit](https://github.com/benawad/lireddit) app that he built during his [14h tutorial](https://youtu.be/I6ypD7qv3Z8) on Youtube.

However, this version uses [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) instead of TypeORM for database access.

> **Note**: This project currently doesn't use any env vars but all instances of `process.env.SOME_VAR` have been replaced by hardcoded values for now.
